Create an app which will detect sharp corners of objects in the given image and also determine their movability score.

For eg: If a Sharp edge of a table is detected in the image, it should highlight the corner and predict its movability score by determining its relative area in the frame.

Knowledge required: Basic
Toughness Level: Medium
Possible modularity: Edge Detection, Size prediction
